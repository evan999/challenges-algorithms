# challenges

A repo for all the different coding challenges covered during sessions
Fork a copy of the repo.

# Challenges Folder
- This folder is where anything covered will go 
- DO NOT MANIPULATE FILES IN THIS FOLDER
- After each session after I push content to github you will be able to sync with master (my repo) and pull into your fork all the changes as long as you have not touched any files in this folder this will work

# Notes Folder
- This is your folder to do with as you please
- I will not touch this folder
- Make copies of content in the Challenges folder to here if you want to add your own notes so that sync will always work.
