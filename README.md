# challenges

- Fork Repo to have a copy for yourself.  
## The Challenges folder
- This folder is the one I will work in.
- Do not touch these files so the next step will work
- Each time I push code you will see a sync option on your forked version so you can bring my changes down to your version

## The Notes folder
- This folder is yours to do with as you please
- Make copies of the files in the challenges folder here so you can add your own notes.
- I will not touch this folder at all.
